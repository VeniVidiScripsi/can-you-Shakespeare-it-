1,As I remember
1,it was upon this fashionbequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns
1,as thou sayest
1,charged my brother
1,on hisblessing
1,to breed me well and there begins mysadness
1,My brother Jaques he keeps at school
1,andreport speaks goldenly of his profit for my part
1,he keeps me rustically at home
1,to speak moreproperly
1,stays me here at home unkept; for call youthat keeping for a gentleman of my birth
1,thatdiffers not from the stalling of an ox? His horsesare bred better; for
1,besides that they are fairwith their feeding
1,they are taught their manage
1,and to that end riders dearly hired but I
1,gain nothing under him but growth; for thewhich his animals on his dunghills are as muchbound to him as I
1,Besides this nothing that he soplentifully gives me
1,the something that nature gaveme his countenance seems to take from me he letsme feed with his hinds
1,bars me the place of abrother
1,as much as in him lies
1,mines mygentility with my education
1,thatgrieves me; and the spirit of my father
1,which Ithink is within me
1,begins to mutiny against thisservitude I will no longer endure it
1,though yet Iknow no wise remedy how to avoid it
1,Yonder comes my master
1,your brother
1,and thou shalt hear how he willshake me up
1,sir! what make you here? Nothing I am not taught to make any thing
1,What mar you then
1,I am helping you to mar that which Godmade
1,a poor unworthy brother of yours
1,with idleness
1,be better employed
1,and be naught awhile
1,Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?What prodigal portion have I spent
1,that I shouldcome to such penury? Know you where your are
1,very well; here in your orchard
1,Know you before whom
1,better than him I am before knows me
1,I knowyou are my eldest brother; and
1,in the gentlecondition of blood
1,you should so know me
1,Thecourtesy of nations allows you my better
1,in thatyou are the first-born; but the same traditiontakes not away my blood
1,were there twenty brothersbetwixt us I have as much of my father in me asyou; albeit
1,your coming before me isnearer to his reverence
1,elder brother
1,you are too young in this
1,Wilt thou lay hands on me
1,villain? I am no villain; I am the youngest son of SirRowland de Boys; he was my father
1,and he is thricea villain that says such a father begot villains
1,Wert thou not my brother
1,I would not take this handfrom thy throat till this other had pulled out thytongue for saying so thou hast railed on thyself
1,Sweet masters
1,be patient for your fathersremembrance
1,be at accord
1,till I please you shall hear me
1,Myfather charged you in his will to give me goodeducation you have trained me like a peasant
1,obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-likequalities
1,The spirit of my father grows strong inme
1,and I will no longer endure it therefore allowme such exercises as may become a gentleman
1,orgive me the poor allottery my father left me bytestament; with that I will go buy my fortunes
1,And what wilt thou do? beg
1,when that is spent?Well
1,get you in I will not long be troubledwith you; you shall have some part of your will Ipray you
1,I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good
1,Get you with him
1,Is old dog my reward? Most true
1,I have lost myteeth in your service
1,God be with my old master!he would not have spoke such a word
1,Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I willphysic your rankness
1,and yet give no thousandcrowns neither
1,Dennis!    Calls your worship? Was not Charles
1,the dukes wrestler
1,here to speak with me? So please you
1,he is here at the door and importunesaccess to you
1,Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is
1,Good morrow to your worship
1,Good Monsieur Charles
1,whats the new news at thenew court? Theres no news at the court
1,but the old newsthat is
1,the old duke is banished by his youngerbrother the new duke; and three or four loving lordshave put themselves into voluntary exile with him
1,whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;therefore he gives them good leave to wander
1,Can you tell if Rosalind
1,the dukes daughter
1,bebanished with her father? O
1,no; for the dukes daughter
1,being ever from their cradles bred together
1,that she would have followed her exile
1,or have diedto stay behind her
1,She is at the court
1,and noless beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; andnever two ladies loved as they do
1,Where will the old duke live? They say he is already in the forest of Arden
1,anda many merry men with him; and there they live likethe old Robin Hood of England they say many younggentlemen flock to him every day
1,and fleet the timecarelessly
1,as they did in the golden world
1,you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke? Marry
1,sir; and I came to acquaint you with amatter
1,secretly to understandthat your younger brother Orlando hath a dispositionto come in disguised against me to try a fall
1,I wrestle for my credit; and he thatescapes me without some broken limb shall acquit himwell
1,Your brother is but young and tender; and
1,for your love
1,I would be loath to foil him
1,for my own honour
1,if he come in therefore
1,out of my love to you
1,I came hither to acquaint youwithal
1,that either you might stay him from hisintendment or brook such disgrace well as he shallrun into
1,in that it is a thing of his own searchand altogether against my will
1,I thank thee for thy love to me
1,whichthou shalt find I will most kindly requite
1,I hadmyself notice of my brothers purpose herein andhave by underhand means laboured to dissuade him fromit
1,but he is resolute
1,Ill tell thee
1,Charlesit is the stubbornest young fellow of France
1,fullof ambition
1,an envious emulator of every mansgood parts
1,a secret and villanous contriver againstme his natural brother therefore use thydiscretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neckas his finger
1,And thou wert best look tot; for ifthou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do notmightily grace himself on thee
1,he will practiseagainst thee by poison
1,entrap thee by sometreacherous device and never leave thee till hehath taen thy life by some indirect means or other;for
1,I assure thee
1,and almost with tears I speakit
1,there is not one so young and so villanous thisday living
1,I speak but brotherly of him; butshould I anatomize him to thee as he is
1,I mustblush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder
1,I am heartily glad I came hither to you
1,If he cometo-morrow
1,Ill give him his payment if ever he goalone again
1,Ill never wrestle for prize more andso God keep your worship! Farewell
1,good Charles
1,Now will I stir this gamester I hope I shall seean end of him; for my soul
1,yet I know not why
1,hates nothing more than he
1,Yet hes gentle
1,neverschooled and yet learned
1,full of noble device
1,ofall sorts enchantingly beloved
1,and indeed so muchin the heart of the world
1,and especially of my ownpeople
1,who best know him
1,that I am altogethermisprised but it shall not be so long; thiswrestler shall clear all nothing remains but thatI kindle the boy thither; which now Ill go about
1,Lawn before the Dukes palace
1,sweet my coz
1,I show more mirth than I am mistress of;and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you couldteach me to forget a banished father
1,you must notlearn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure
1,Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weightthat I love thee
1,thy banished father
1,had banished thy uncle
1,the duke my father
1,so thouhadst been still with me
1,I could have taught mylove to take thy father for mine so wouldst thou
1,if the truth of thy love to me were so righteouslytempered as mine is to thee
1,I will forget the condition of my estate
1,torejoice in yours
1,You know my father hath no child but I
1,nor none islike to have and
1,when he dies
1,thou shaltbe his heir
1,for what he hath taken away from thyfather perforce
1,I will render thee again inaffection; by mine honour
1,I will; and when I breakthat oath
1,let me turn monster therefore
1,mysweet Rose
1,my dear Rose
1,From henceforth I will
1,and devise sports
1,Letme see; what think you of falling in love? Marry
1,to make sport withal butlove no man in good earnest; nor no further in sportneither than with safety of a pure blush thou maystin honour come off again
1,What shall be our sport
1,then? Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune fromher wheel
1,that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally
1,I would we could do so
1,for her benefits aremightily misplaced
1,and the bountiful blind womandoth most mistake in her gifts to women
1,Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarcemakes honest
1,and those that she makes honest shemakes very ill-favouredly
1,now thou goest from Fortunes office toNatures Fortune reigns in gifts of the world
1,not in the lineaments of Nature
1,No? when Nature hath made a fair creature
1,may shenot by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Naturehath given us wit to flout at Fortune
1,hath notFortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument? Indeed
1,there is Fortune too hard for Nature
1,whenFortune makes Natures natural the cutter-off ofNatures wit
1,Peradventure this is not Fortunes work neither
1,butNatures; who perceiveth our natural wits too dullto reason of such goddesses and hath sent thisnatural for our whetstone; for always the dulness ofthe fool is the whetstone of the wits
1,wit! whither wander you? Mistress
1,you must come away to your father
1,Were you made the messenger? No
1,by mine honour
1,but I was bid to come for you
1,Where learned you that oath
1,fool? Of a certain knight that swore by his honour theywere good pancakes and swore by his honour themustard was naught now Ill stand to it
1,thepancakes were naught and the mustard was good
1,yet was not the knight forsworn
1,Now is the winter of our discontentMade glorious summer by this sun of York;And all the clouds that lourd upon our houseIn the deep bosom of the ocean buried
1,Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings
1,Our dreadful marches to delightful measures
1,Grim-visaged war hath smoothd his wrinkled front;And now
1,instead of mounting barbed steedsTo fright the souls of fearful adversaries
1,He capers nimbly in a ladys chamberTo the lascivious pleasing of a lute
1,that am not shaped for sportive tricks
1,Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;I
1,that am rudely stampd
1,and want loves majestyTo strut before a wanton ambling nymph;I
1,that am curtaild of this fair proportion
1,Cheated of feature by dissembling nature
1,sent before my timeInto this breathing world
1,scarce half made up
1,And that so lamely and unfashionableThat dogs bark at me as I halt by them;Why
1,in this weak piping time of peace
1,Have no delight to pass away the time
1,Unless to spy my shadow in the sunAnd descant on mine own deformityAnd therefore
1,since I cannot prove a lover
1,To entertain these fair well-spoken days
1,I am determined to prove a villainAnd hate the idle pleasures of these days
1,Plots have I laid
1,inductions dangerous
1,By drunken prophecies
1,libels and dreams
1,To set my brother Clarence and the kingIn deadly hate the one against the otherAnd if King Edward be as true and justAs I am subtle
1,false and treacherous
1,This day should Clarence closely be mewd up
1,About a prophecy
1,which says that GOf Edwards heirs the murderer shall be
1,down to my soul hereClarence comes
1,good day; what means this armed guardThat waits upon your grace? His majestyTendering my persons safety
1,hath appointedThis conduct to convey me to the Tower
1,Upon what cause? Because my name is George
1,commit your godfathersO
1,belike his majesty hath some intentThat you shall be new-christend in the Tower
1,But whats the matter
1,Clarence? may I know? Yea
1,when I know; for I protestAs yet I do not but
1,as I can learn
1,He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;And from the cross-row plucks the letter G
1,And says a wizard told him that by GHis issue disinherited should be;And
1,for my name of George begins with G
1,It follows in his thought that I am he
1,and such like toys as theseHave moved his highness to commit me now
1,tis sheThat tempers him to this extremity
1,Was it not she and that good man of worship
1,Anthony Woodville
1,her brother there
1,That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower
1,From whence this present day he is deliverd?We are not safe
1,Clarence; we are not safe
1,and must obey
1,I think theres no man is secureBut the queens kindred and night-walking heraldsThat trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore
1,Heard ye not what an humble suppliantLord hastings was to her for his delivery? Humbly complaining to her deityGot my lord chamberlain his liberty
1,Ill tell you what; I think it is our way
1,If we will keep in favour with the king
1,To be her men and wear her liveryThe jealous oerworn widow and herself
1,Since that our brother dubbd them gentlewomen
1,Are mighty gossips in this monarchy
1,I beseech your graces both to pardon me;His majesty hath straitly given in chargeThat no man shall have private conference
1,Of what degree soever
1,with his brother
1,Even so; ant please your worship
1,have patience
1,You may partake of any thing we sayWe speak no treason
1,man we say the kingIs wise and virtuous
1,and his noble queenWell struck in years
1,I must perforce
1,and not jealous;We say that Shores wife hath a pretty foot
1,A cherry lip
1,your imprisonment shall not be long;Meantime
1,a passing pleasing tongue;And that the queens kindred are made gentle-folksHow say you sir? Can you deny all this? With this
1,I will perform it to enfranchise you
1,myself have nought to do
1,Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee
1,farewell I will unto the king;And whatsoever you will employ me in
1,He that doth naught with her
1,excepting one
1,Were best he do it secretly
1,this deep disgrace in brotherhoodTouches me deeper than you can imagine
1,I know it pleaseth neither of us well
1,my lord? Her husband
1,knave wouldst thou betray me? I beseech your grace to pardon me
1,and withalForbear your conference with the noble duke
1,We know thy charge
1,Were it to call King Edwards widow sister
1,and will obey
1,We are the queens abjects
1,tread the path that thou shalt neer return
1,and Guard Go
1,plain Clarence! I do love thee so
1,That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven
1,If heaven will take the present at our hands
1,But who comes here? the new-deliverd Hastings?    Good time of day unto my gracious lord! As much unto my good lord chamberlain!Well are you welcome to the open air
1,How hath your lordship brookd imprisonment? With patience
1,he hath kept an evil diet long
1,as prisoners mustBut I shall live
1,by Saint Paul
1,to give them thanksThat were the cause of my imprisonment
1,this news is bad indeed
1,no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;For they that were your enemies are his
1,And have prevaild as much on him as you
1,More pity that the eagle should be mewd
1,While kites and buzzards prey at liberty
1,What news abroad? No news so bad abroad as this at home;The King is sickly
1,weak and melancholy
1,And his physicians fear him mightily
1,is he in his bed? He is
1,Go you before
1,and I will follow you
1,He cannot live
1,I hope; and must not dieTill George be packd with post-horse up to heaven
1,And overmuch consumed his royal personTis very grievous to be thought upon
1,to urge his hatred more to Clarence
1,With lies well steeld with weighty arguments;And
1,if I fall not in my deep intent
1,Clarence hath not another day to liveWhich done
1,God take King Edward to his mercy
1,And leave the world for me to bustle in!For then Ill marry Warwicks youngest daughter
1,What though I killd her husband and her father?The readiest way to make the wench amendsIs to become her husband and her fatherThe which will I; not all so much for loveAs for another secret close intent
1,By marrying her which I must reach unto
1,But yet I run before my horse to marketClarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reignsWhen they are gone
1,then must I count my gains
1,Than I can wish to adders
1,set down your honourable load
1,If honour may be shrouded in a hearse
1,Whilst I awhile obsequiously lamentThe untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster
1,Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost
1,To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne
1,Wife to thy Edward
1,to thy slaughterd son
1,Stabbd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!Lo
1,in these windows that let forth thy life
1,I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes
1,Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!More direful hap betide that hated wretch
1,That makes us wretched by the death of thee
1,abortive be it
1,Or any creeping venomd thing that lives!If ever he have child
1,and untimely brought to light
1,Whose ugly and unnatural aspectMay fright the hopeful mother at the view;And that be heir to his unhappiness!If ever he have wife
1,let her he madeA miserable by the death of himAs I am made by my poor lord and thee!Come
1,now towards Chertsey with your holy load
1,Taken from Pauls to be interred there;And still
1,as you are weary of the weight
1,whiles I lament King Henrys corse
1,you that bear the corse
1,and set it down
1,What black magician conjures up this fiend
1,To stop devoted charitable deeds? Villains
1,set down the corse; or
1,by Saint Paul
1,make a corse of him that disobeys
1,GentlemanMy lord
1,Filld it with cursing cries and deep exclaims
1,and let the coffin pass
1,Unmannerd dog! stand thou
1,when I commandAdvance thy halbert higher than my breast
1,be not so curst
1,by Saint Paul
1,Ill strike thee to my foot
1,And spurn upon thee
1,Behold this pattern of thy butcheries
1,for thy boldness
1,for Gods sake
1,do you tremble? are you all afraid?Alas
1,I blame you not; for you are mortal
1,And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil
1,If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds
1,thou dreadful minister of hell!Thou hadst but power over his mortal body
1,His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone
1,and trouble us not;For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell
1,Provokes this deluge most unnatural
1,inhuman and unnatural
1,which this blood madest
1,revenge his death!O earth
1,which this blood drinkst revenge his death!Either heaven with lightning strike themurderer dead
1,where no blood dwells;Thy deed
1,gape open wide and eat him quick
1,As thou dost swallow up this good kings bloodWhich his hell-governd arm hath butchered! Lady
1,you know no rules of charity
1,Which renders good for bad
1,blessings for curses
1,thou knowst no law of God nor manNo beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity
1,My spirits to attend this double voice accorded
1,And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale
1,Tearing of papers
1,breaking rings a-twain
1,Storming her world with sorrows wind and rain
1,Upon her head a platted hive of straw
1,Which fortified her visage from the sun
1,Whereon the thought might think sometime it sawThe carcass of beauty spent and doneTime had not scythed all that youth begun
1,Nor youth all quit; but
1,spite of heavens fell rage
1,Some beauty peepd through lattice of seard age
1,Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne
1,Which on it had conceited characters
1,Laundering the silken figures in the brineThat seasond woe had pelleted in tears
1,And often reading what contents it bears;As often shrieking undistinguishd woe
1,In clamours of all size
1,both high and low
1,Sometimes her levelld eyes their carriage ride
1,As they did battery to the spheres intend;Sometime diverted their poor balls are tiedTo the orbed earth; sometimes they do extendTheir view right on; anon their gazes lendTo every place at once
1,thou lump of foul deformity;For tis thy presence that exhales this blood From cold and empty veins
1,nowhere fixd
1,The mind and sight distractedly commixd
1,A thousand favours from a maund she drewOf amber
1,see! dead Henrys woundsOpen their congeald mouths and bleed afresh!Blush
1,and of beaded jet
1,Which one by one she in a river threw
1,Upon whose weeping margent she was set;Like usury
1,applying wet to wet
1,Or monarchs hands that let not bounty fallWhere want cries some
1,but where excess begs all
1,Of folded schedules had she many a one
1,Which she perused
1,and thereof free;Yet
1,if men moved him
1,and gave the flood;Crackd many a ring of posied gold and boneBidding them find their sepulchres in mud;Found yet moe letters sadly pennd in blood
1,With sleided silk feat and affectedlyEnswathed
1,and seald to curious secrecy
1,These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes
1,And often kissd
1,and often gan to tearCried O false blood
1,thou register of lies
1,What unapproved witness dost thou bear!Ink would have seemd more black and damned here!This said
1,in top of rage the lines she rents
1,Big discontent so breaking their contents
1,A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh--Sometime a blusterer
1,that the ruffle knewOf court
1,was he such a stormAs oft twixt May and April is to see
1,and had let go byThe swiftest hours
1,observed as they flew--Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew
1,When winds breathe sweet
1,privileged by age
1,desires to knowIn brief the grounds and motives of her woe
1,So slides he down upon his grained bat
1,And comely-distant sits he by her side;When he again desires her
1,untidy though they be
1,Her grievance with his hearing to divideIf that from him there may be aught appliedWhich may her suffering ecstasy assuage
1,Tis promised in the charity of age
1,His rudeness so with his authorized youthDid livery falseness in a pride of truth
1,Well could he ride
1,though in me you beholdThe injury of many a blasting hour
1,Let it not tell your judgment I am old;Not age
1,and often men would sayThat horse his mettle from his rider takesProud of subjection
1,over me hath powerI might as yet have been a spreading flower
1,Fresh to myself
1,If I had self-appliedLove to myself and to no love beside
1,noble by the sway
1,woe is me! too early I attendedA youthful suit--it was to gain my grace--Of one by natures outwards so commended
1,That maidens eyes stuck over all his faceLove lackd a dwelling
1,and made him her place;And when in his fair parts she did abide
1,She was new lodged and newly deified
1,His browny locks did hang in crooked curls;And every light occasion of the windUpon his lips their silken parcels hurls
1,Whats sweet to do
1,to do will aptly findEach eye that saw him did enchant the mind
1,For on his visage was in little drawnWhat largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn
1,Small show of man was yet upon his chin;His phoenix down began but to appearLike unshorn velvet on that termless skinWhose bare out-braggd the web it seemd to wearYet showd his visage by that cost more dear;And nice affections wavering stood in doubtIf best were as it was
1,or best without
1,His qualities were beauteous as his form
1,For maiden-tongued he was
1,what stophe makes!And controversy hence a question takes
1,Whether the horse by him became his deed
1,Or he his manage by the well-doing steed
1,But quickly on this side the verdict wentHis real habitude gave life and graceTo appertainings and to ornament
1,Accomplishd in himself
1,not in his caseAll aids
1,themselves made fairer by their place
1,Came for additions; yet their purposed trimPieced not his grace
1,but were all graced by him
1,So on the tip of his subduing tongueAll kinds of arguments and question deep
1,All replication prompt
1,and reason strong
1,For his advantage still did wake and sleepTo make the weeper laugh
1,the laugher weep
1,He had the dialect and different skill
1,Catching all passions in his craft of willThat he did in the general bosom reignOf young
1,of old; and sexes both enchanted
1,To dwell with him in thoughts
1,or to remainIn personal duty
1,following where he hauntedConsents bewitchd
1,ere he desire
1,have granted;And dialogued for him what he would say
1,Askd their own wills
1,and made their wills obey
1,Many there were that did his picture get
1,To serve their eyes
1,and in it put their mind;Like fools that in th imagination setThe goodly objects which abroad they findOf lands and mansions
1,theirs in thought assignd;And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow themThan the true gouty landlord which doth owe themSo many have
1,that never touchd his hand
1,Sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart
1,My woeful self
1,that did in freedom stand
1,And was my own fee-simple
1,What with his art in youth
1,and youth in art
1,Threw my affections in his charmed power
1,Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower
1,Yet did I not
1,as some my equals did
1,Demand of him
1,nor being desired yielded;Finding myself in honour so forbid
1,With safest distance I mine honour shieldedExperience for me many bulwarks buildedOf proofs new-bleeding
1,which remaind the foilOf this false jewel
1,and his amorous spoil
1,who ever shunnd by precedentThe destined ill she must herself assay?Or forced examples
1,gainst her own content
1,To put the by-past perils in her way?Counsel may stop awhile what will not stay;For when we rage
1,advice is often seenBy blunting us to make our wits more keen
1,Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood
1,That we must curb it upon others proof;To be forbod the sweets that seem so good
1,For fear of harms that preach in our behoof
1,commanding in his monarchy
1,from judgment stand aloof!The one a palate hath that needs will taste
1,Though Reason weep
1,but mine own was free
1,It is thy last
1,For further I could say This mans untrue
1,And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;Heard where his plants in others orchards grew
1,Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling;Thought characters and words merely but art
1,And bastards of his foul adulterate heart
1,And long upon these terms I held my city
1,Till thus he gan besiege me Gentle maid
1,Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity
1,And be not of my holy vows afraidThats to ye sworn to none was ever said;For feasts of love I have been calld unto
1,Till now did neer invite
1,nor never woo
1,All my offences that abroad you seeAre errors of the blood
1,none of the mind;Love made them not with acture they may be
1,Where neither party is nor true nor kindThey sought their shame that so their shame did find;And so much less of shame in me remains
1,By how much of me their reproach contains
1,Among the many that mine eyes have seen
1,Not one whose flame my heart so much as warmd
1,Or my affection put to the smallest teen
1,Or any of my leisures ever charmdHarm have I done to them
1,but neer was harmd;Kept hearts in liveries
1,what tributes wounded fancies sent me
1,Of paled pearls and rubies red as blood;Figuring that they their passions likewise lent meOf grief and blushes
1,aptly understoodIn bloodless white and the encrimsond mood;Effects of terror and dear modesty
1,Encampd in hearts
1,but fighting outwardly
1,advance of yours that phraseless hand
1,Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;Take all these similes to your own command
1,behold these talents of their hair
1,With twisted metal amorously impleachd
1,I have received from many a several fair
1,Their kind acceptance weepingly beseechd
1,With the annexions of fair gems enrichd
1,And deep-braind sonnets that did amplifyEach stones dear nature
1,Hallowd with sighs that burning lungs did raise;What me your minister
1,for you obeys
1,Works under you; and to your audit comesTheir distract parcels in combined sums
1,To spend her living in eternal love
1,twas beautiful and hard
1,Whereto his invised properties did tend;The deep-green emerald
1,in whose fresh regardWeak sights their sickly radiance do amend;The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blendWith objects manifold each several stone
1,With wit well blazond
1,smiled or made some moan
1,this device was sent me from a nun
1,all these trophies of affections hot
1,Of pensived and subdued desires the tender
1,Nature hath charged me that I hoard them not
1,But yield them up where I myself must render
1,Or sister sanctified
1,of holiest note;Which late her noble suit in court did shun
1,my origin and ender;For these
1,Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;For she was sought by spirits of richest coat
1,must your oblations be
1,Since I their altar
1,you enpatron me
1,But kept cold distance
1,and did thence remove
1,what labour ist to leaveThe thing we have not
1,mastering what not strives
1,Playing the place which did no form receive
1,Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves?She that her fame so to herself contrives
1,The scars of battle scapeth by the flight
1,And makes her absence valiant
1,not her might
1,all liberty procured
1,How mighty then you are
1,in that my boast is trueThe accident which brought me to her eyeUpon the moment did her force subdue
1,And now she would the caged cloister flyReligious love put out Religions eyeNot to be tempted
1,would she be immured
1,hear me tell!The broken bosoms that to me belongHave emptied all their fountains in my well
1,And mine I pour your ocean all amongI strong oer them
1,and you oer me being strong
1,Must for your victory us all congest
1,As compound love to physic your cold breast
1,My parts had power to charm a sacred nun
1,and unfold yourself
1,Long live the king!Bernardo?He
1,You come most carefully upon your hour
1,Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed
1,dieted in grace
1,For this relief much thanks tis bitter cold
1,And I am sick at heart
1,Have you had quiet guard? Not a mouse stirring
1,Give you good night
1,Holla! Bernardo! Say
1,If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus
1,The rivals of my watch
1,bid them make haste
1,I think I hear them
1,honest soldierWho hath relieved you? Bernardo has my place

1,And liegemen to the Dane
1,Give you good night
1,Horatio welcome
1,good Marcellus
1,is Horatio there? A piece of him
1,has this thing appeard again to-night? I have seen nothing
1,Horatio says tis but our fantasy
1,And will not let belief take hold of himTouching this dreaded sight
1,twice seen of usTherefore I have entreated him alongWith us to watch the minutes of this night;That if again this apparition come
1,He may approve our eyes and speak to it
1,and will not answer
1,it stalks away! Stay! speak
1,twill not appear
1,Sit down awhile;And let us once again assail your ears
1,That are so fortified against our storyWhat we have two nights seen
1,Together with that fair and warlike formIn which the majesty of buried DenmarkDid sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee
1,speak! It is offended
1,And let us hear Bernardo speak of this
1,Last night of all
1,When yond same star thats westward from the poleHad made his course to illume that part of heavenWhere now it burns
1,Marcellus and myself
1,The bell then beating one
1,Looks it not like the king? mark it
1,break thee off; look
1,where it comes again! In the same figure
1,like the king thats dead
1,Thou art a scholar; speak to it
1,speak! I charge thee
1,speak! Tis gone
1,What art thou that usurpst this time of night
1,Most like it harrows me with fear and wonder
1,It would be spoke to
1,Thus twice before
1,and jump at this dead hour
1,With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch
1,In what particular thought to work I know not;But in the gross and scope of my opinion
1,This bodes some strange eruption to our state
1,in an angry parle
1,He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice
1,Horatio! you tremble and look paleIs not this something more than fantasy?What think you ont? Before my God
1,I might not this believeWithout the sensible and true avouchOf mine own eyes
1,Is it not like the king? As thou art to thyselfSuch was the very armour he had onWhen he the ambitious Norway combated;So frownd he once
1,And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
1,And foreign mart for implements of war;Why such impress of shipwrights
1,whose sore taskDoes not divide the Sunday from the week;What might be toward
1,that this sweaty hasteDoth make the night joint-labourer with the dayWho ist that can inform me? That can I;At least
1,the whisper goes so
1,Our last king
1,Whose image even but now appeard to us
1,with his life
1,all those his landsWhich he stood seized of
1,to the conquerorAgainst the which
1,a moiety competentWas gaged by our king; which had returndTo the inheritance of Fortinbras
1,Had he been vanquisher; as
1,by the same covenant
1,And carriage of the article designd
1,His fell to Hamlet
1,Thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride
1,Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--For so this side of our known world esteemd him--Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seald compact
1,young Fortinbras
1,Of unimproved mettle hot and full
1,Hath in the skirts of Norway here and thereSharkd up a list of lawless resolutes
1,For food and diet
1,to some enterpriseThat hath a stomach int; which is no other--As it doth well appear unto our state--But to recover of us
1,by strong handAnd terms compulsatory
1,those foresaid landsSo by his father lost and this
1,by Fortinbras of Norway
1,Is the main motive of our preparations
1,The source of this our watch and the chief headOf this post-haste and romage in the land
1,I think it be no other but een soWell may it sort that this portentous figureComes armed through our watch; so like the kingThat was and is the question of these wars
1,A mote it is to trouble the minds eye
1,In the most high and palmy state of Rome
1,A little ere the mightiest Julius fell
1,The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted deadDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streetsAs stars with trains of fire and dews of blood
1,Disasters in the sun; and the moist starUpon whose influence Neptunes empire standsWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipseAnd even the like precurse of fierce events
1,As harbingers preceding still the fatesAnd prologue to the omen coming on
1,Have heaven and earth together demonstratedUnto our climatures and countrymen
1,he that knows
1,Why this same strict and most observant watchSo nightly toils the subject of the land
1,where it comes again!Re-enter GhostIll cross it
1,though it blast me
1,foreknowing may avoid
1,illusion!If thou hast any sound
1,or use of voice
1,Speak to meIf there be any good thing to be done
1,That may to thee do ease and grace to me
1,Speak to meCock crowsIf thou art privy to thy countrys fate
1,you spirits oft walk in death
1,Speak of it stay
1,and speak! Stop it
1,speak!Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy lifeExtorted treasure in the womb of earth
1,Shall I strike at it with my partisan? Do
1,if it will not stand
1,Tis here! Tis here! Tis gone!We do it wrong
1,being so majestical
1,To offer it the show of violence;For it is
1,Well ratified by law and heraldry
1,invulnerable
1,And our vain blows malicious mockery
1,It was about to speak
1,when the cock crew
1,And then it started like a guilty thingUpon a fearful summons
1,I have heard
1,more than the scopeOf these delated articles allow
1,that is the trumpet to the morn
1,Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throatAwake the god of day; and
1,at his warning
1,Whether in sea or fire
1,in earth or air
1,The extravagant and erring spirit hiesTo his confine and of the truth hereinThis present object made probation
1,It faded on the crowing of the cock
1,Some say that ever gainst that season comesWherein our Saviours birth is celebrated
1,The bird of dawning singeth all night longAnd then
1,What wouldst thou have
1,no spirit dares stir abroad;The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike
1,No fairy takes
1,nor witch hath power to charm
1,So hallowd and so gracious is the time
1,So have I heard and do in part believe it
1,and let your haste commend your duty
1,In that and all things will we show our duty
1,We doubt it nothing heartily farewell
1,in russet mantle clad
1,Walks oer the dew of yon high eastward hillBreak we our watch up; and by my advice
1,Let us impart what we have seen to-nightUnto young Hamlet; for
1,upon my life
1,Exeunt   and And now
1,Your leave and favour to return to France;From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
1,will speak to him
1,Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it
1,As needful in our loves
1,fitting our duty? Lets dot
1,I pray; and I this morning knowWhere we shall find him most conveniently
1,whats the news with you?You told us of some suit; what ist
1,A room of state in the castle
1,Laertes?You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
1,Though yet of Hamlet our dear brothers deathThe memory be green
1,and that it us befittedTo bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdomTo be contracted in one brow of woe
1,Yet so far hath discretion fought with natureThat we with wisest sorrow think on him
1,Together with remembrance of ourselves
1,Therefore our sometime sister
1,now our queen
1,The imperial jointress to this warlike state
1,not thy asking?The head is not more native to the heart
1,as twere with a defeated joy
1,With an auspicious and a dropping eye
1,With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage
1,In equal scale weighing delight and dole
1,Taken to wife nor have we herein barrdYour better wisdoms
1,which have freely goneWith this affair along
1,And loose your voice what wouldst thou beg
1,To show my duty in your coronation
1,That shall not be my offer
1,that you know
1,young Fortinbras
1,Holding a weak supposal of our worth
1,Or thinking by our late dear brothers deathOur state to be disjoint and out of frame
1,Colleagued with the dream of his advantage
1,He hath not faild to pester us with message
1,Importing the surrender of those landsLost by his father
1,with all bonds of law
