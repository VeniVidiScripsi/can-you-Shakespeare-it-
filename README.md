 # can you Shakespeare it?
A tiny language model that claims to be able to distinguish Shakespearean texts from others. Trained in Python with dedicated libraries such as pandas.

The model should give 83 percent accuracy. But that's not really either... need to work on expanding the data to get a more accurate model.



## how to use
You need Python installed on your computer first

Install the following packages (use the command line):

    pip install scikit-learn pandas


### Download the following files:


`Load_the_saved_model2.py`

`shakespeare_model.joblib`

`tfidf_vectorizer.joblib`

`run.bat`

Change the path of the "Load_the_saved_model2.py" file inside run.bat to its current location on your system.


### Run the file: `run.bat`

And write a sonnet!

For optimal results, more data should be given.
Therefore, it is better to copy an entire paragraph than a single sentence.
